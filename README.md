# Vim Configuration

## Overview

I generally use neovim but when reasonable config files should work properly
with upstream vim.  No effort for vi compatibility is made.  I use a
mouse/trackpad when appropriate.  Plugins are organized as git submodules and
use vim's native plugin support.

I'm still very much learning but figured creating a well-documented config would
help be better understand this editor.
